# =============================================================================
# CLUSTER ROLE BINDING: cluster-admin → my-admin group
# Assigns the built-in "cluster-admin" ClusterRole to the "my-admin" K8s group.
# No custom ClusterRole needed — "cluster-admin" is built into every K8s cluster
# and grants full unrestricted access to all resources.
# Any IAM user/role mapped to "my-admin" (via EKS access entry in
# 10-add-manager-role.tf) gets full admin access to the cluster.
