# =============================================================================
# INGRESS: myapp (NGINX Ingress + TLS via cert-manager)
# Routes external traffic via NGINX with HTTPS support.
# Uses the NLB already created by 16-nginx-ingress.tf.
#
# Traffic flow:
#   Internet → NLB → NGINX pod (terminates TLS) → matches host
#   → matches path "/" → forwards to service "myapp" on port 8080
#
# TLS flow:
#   1. This Ingress is created with the cert-manager annotation
#   2. Cert-manager sees it → requests cert from Let's Encrypt staging
#   3. Let's Encrypt verifies domain via HTTP01 challenge on port 80
#   4. Certificate is stored in Secret "ex9-tls-cert"
#   5. NGINX loads the certificate and serves HTTPS on port 443
#   6. Cert-manager auto-renews before expiry
